The purpose of this project is to analyze H-1B Employer Data providing information on employers petitioning for H-1B workers from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2020 (quarter 2).
I'm interested in seeing the approval and denial data extracted from Form I-129 submitted to USCIS, and in particular, I would like to know the approval and denial rates by employer in the last 5 years.
From a human-centered perspective, the goal of this analysis is to understand both the trend of approval and denial rates over years as well as possible factors affecting such decison in the immigration system. 
I intend to conduct this analysis in a reproducible way such that other temporary foreign workers might find it useful and apply it into their own analysis.
