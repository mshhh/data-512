# A1: Bias in data 
The goal of this project is to identify potential sources of bias in two datasets, "Wikipedia Talk Labels: Toxicity‚Äù and "Wikipedia Talk Labels: Personal Attacks", from the Wikipedia Talk corpus, and to perform an exploratory data analysis based on those data. The analysis is done in a Jupyter Notebook including a description about some implications of the bias and some suggestions on correcting those bias and reducing negative consequences.
